# Data centers
>A datacenter in the Spearhead Cloud is also an API endpoint which you can manage via the [Spearhead Cloud Tools](https://docs.spearhead.cloud/cloud-portal).

> As of March 2018 the [ro-1 datacenter](https://eu-ro-1.api.spearhead.cloud) is active. Please note that you should download the latest [cacert.pem](https://curl.haxx.se/docs/caextract.html) from curl.haxx.se and export `export CURL_CA_BUNDLE=~/Downloads/cacert.pem` when using spearhead-compose commands.
