# Infrastructure containers

Infrastructure containers provide bare metal performance and a familiar unix environment.

All infrastructure containers provide security isolation and high performance.

Infrastructure containers also offer elasticity allowing you to scale from one instance to a larger one without any downtime.

The high performance of infrastructure containers is due to the fact that we run directly on bare metal without any virtualization overhead.
