## Overview
The Spearhead Cloud allows you to quickly and easily set-up high performance bare metal containers and virtual machines.

### Compute
The Spearhead Cloud delivers bare metal performance without the use of virtualization for our containers which allows you to dynamically scale in real-time without any downtime.
Our virtualization technology is based on the well known KVM virtualization stack and provides close to bare metal performance for your legacy workloads.

### Storage
Without the hassle of shared block storage, we know precisely what our hardware can handle and design accordingly so that every tenant gets its fair share of the required IO.

### Network
Spearhead Cloud provides a complete software-defined-networking stack allowing for full IP stacks, easy management.

### Security
Spearhead Cloud leverages well known Zones technology to keep tenants from seeing each others data but also assures that everyone gets their share of the resources.

### Debugging and Visibility
The Spearhead Cloud provides complete visibility for your systems and applications though dynamic tracing, complex monitoring and native docker logging.
